## Breast Cancer Cell Detection


### About

The task is to develop a model that predicts whether a biopsied breast cell is benign (not harmful) or malignant (cancerous), given a set of attributes about the cell.

* What features of a cell are the largest drivers of malignancy?
* There is a non-zero cost in time and money to collect each feature about a given cell. How would you go about determining the most cost-effective method of detecting malignancy?


### Data

The dataset consists of 699 cells for which you have the following features:

* Sample code number: id number
* Clump Thickness: 1 - 10
* Uniformity of Cell Size: 1 - 10
* Uniformity of Cell Shape: 1 - 10
* Marginal Adhesion: 1 - 10
* Single Epithelial Cell Size: 1 - 10
* Bare Nuclei: 1 - 10
* Bland Chromatin: 1 - 10
* Normal Nucleoli: 1 - 10
* Mitoses: 1 - 10
* Class: (2 for benign, 4 for malignant)
